# AIPM Story Hierarchy Plan (Deprecated)

The canonical hierarchy rules, level semantics, status tags, and distribution targets now live in:

- [`docs/user-stories.md`](./user-stories.md) → **Canonical hierarchy rules (authoritative)**

This file is retained only as a historical pointer. Please update references to use
`docs/user-stories.md` as the source of truth.
