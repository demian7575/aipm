# Negotiable Criterion

## Definition
**Negotiable**: Details can be discussed

## Key Characteristics
- Describes what, not how
- Leaves room for implementation choices
- Allows for creative solutions
- Can be refined through conversation

## Validation Checks
- Avoids specific technical implementation
- No rigid UI mockups or exact workflows
- Focuses on user needs, not system design
- Allows multiple solution approaches

## Examples

### ✅ Negotiable Stories
- "View project status" - many ways to display
- "Export data" - format and method flexible
- "Notify users of changes" - delivery method open

### ❌ Over-Specified Stories
- "Display red button in top-right corner" - too prescriptive
- "Use PostgreSQL to store user data" - locks in technology
- "Send email at exactly 9 AM daily" - inflexible timing

## Making Stories Negotiable
- Focus on user outcomes, not solutions
- Remove implementation constraints
- Use "what" language, avoid "how" details
- Leave technical decisions to developers

## AIPM System Impact
- Teams can choose optimal implementation
- Encourages collaboration and discussion
- Allows for iterative refinement
- Supports agile development practices
