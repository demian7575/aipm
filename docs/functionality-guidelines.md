**I want** [functionality/goal]

## Rules
- Start with action verb

- Keep concise and specific
- Focus on what, not how

## Action Verbs

- to generate reports

**Modify/Update:**

## Examples

**Good:**
- I want **to view all active stories**
- I want **to create child stories**
- I want **to export test results**
- I want **to assign story components**

**Avoid:**
- I want **a dashboard that shows stories** (implementation)
