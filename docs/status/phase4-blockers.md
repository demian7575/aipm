# Phase 4 Execution Blockers

The outline tree enhancements described for Phase 4 rely on foundations that are not yet
implemented in this repository. The previous statement — "Unable to proceed with the Phase 4
implementation within the current session" — reflects the following constraints:

1. **Backend services are absent.**
   - Phase 4 requires move/reorder endpoints, depth guards, status transitions, and
     branch-synchronisation APIs.
   - These capabilities are scheduled for Phase 2. Without them the outline tree cannot
     persist mutations or fetch hierarchical data beyond the static seed used in tests.

2. **Frontend application shell is not available.**
   - Virtualised trees, keyboard interactions, and persistence logic depend on the React
     application introduced in Phase 3.
   - Until the frontend shell, state management, and API client layers exist, there is no
     location to mount the outline tree experience or to wire keyboard shortcuts.

3. **Shared contracts are the only implemented artefacts.**
   - Phase 1 delivered validation utilities and OpenAPI descriptions, but no UI framework,
     routing, or interaction tests are present yet.
   - Jumping ahead to the Phase 4 deliverables would require the missing infrastructure,
     effectively reimplementing Phases 2 and 3 out of sequence.

4. **Testing and accessibility tooling are deferred.**
   - Phase 4's acceptance criteria include accessibility linting, unit tests, and interaction
     coverage. The current toolchain (pure Node scripts) lacks the React testing environment
     needed for those checks.

Because these prerequisites are unresolved, the correct next step is to complete Phases 2 and 3
before attempting the outline tree functionality. Once those phases introduce the backend API
and frontend shell, Phase 4 can proceed with the rich tree interactions described in the
implementation plan.
