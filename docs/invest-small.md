# Small Criterion

## Definition
**Small**: Fits within a sprint

## Key Characteristics
- Completable in one iteration
- Manageable scope for small team
- Can be developed, tested, and delivered quickly
- Reduces risk and complexity

## Validation Checks
- Story points typically ≤ 13
- Can be completed in 1-2 weeks
- Single developer can understand entire scope
- Minimal coordination required

## Size Guidelines

### Story Point Ranges
- **1-3 points**: Simple changes, bug fixes
- **5-8 points**: Standard features, moderate complexity
- **13 points**: Large but manageable features
- **21+ points**: Too large, needs splitting

### Time Estimates
- Small stories: 1-3 days
- Medium stories: 3-7 days
- Large stories: 1-2 weeks
- Epic stories: Multiple sprints (split required)

## Examples

### ✅ Small Stories
- "Add email validation to login form" (2 points)
- "Create story export button" (3 points)
- "Display component workload chart" (8 points)

### ❌ Too Large
- "Build complete user management system" (epic)
- "Implement full reporting dashboard" (multiple features)
- "Migrate entire database schema" (infrastructure change)

## Making Stories Small
- Split by user workflow steps
- Separate UI from backend logic
- Create incremental value deliveries
- Extract shared components

## AIPM System Impact
- Enables frequent delivery and feedback
- Reduces integration complexity
- Supports continuous deployment
- Improves team velocity tracking
