# Estimable Criterion

## Definition
**Estimable**: Can be sized appropriately

## Key Characteristics
- Team understands the scope and complexity
- Effort can be reasonably predicted
- Requirements are clear enough to estimate
- Technical approach is understood

## Validation Checks
- Story has sufficient detail for sizing
- No major unknowns or research spikes
- Team has relevant experience or knowledge
- Acceptance criteria are defined

## Estimation Factors

### Complexity
- Technical difficulty level
- Number of components involved
- Integration requirements
- Performance considerations

### Clarity
- Requirements are well-defined
- Edge cases are identified
- Dependencies are understood
- Success criteria are clear

## Examples

### ✅ Estimable Stories
- "Create user login form" - standard web form (3 points)
- "Export CSV report" - known data format (2 points)
- "Add story filtering" - UI enhancement (5 points)

### ❌ Hard to Estimate
- "Improve system performance" - vague scope
- "Research best authentication method" - open-ended
- "Integrate with third-party API" - unknown complexity

## Making Stories Estimable
- Break down large or vague stories
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Identify technical dependencies
- Separate research from implementation

## AIPM System Impact
- Enables accurate sprint planning
- Supports story point validation (1,2,3,5,8,13,21)
- Helps identify stories needing refinement
- Improves delivery predictability
