I'm ready to execute the complete development workflow when provided with the required input data (taskTitle, objective, constraints, prNumber, branchName, language).

The template establishes me as a Code Generator with authority to generate code following specifications exactly, and requires me to execute the complete GitHub workflow from checkout to push without questions or explanations.

When you provide the input data, I will immediately execute the 11-step workflow including:
1. Accessing the GitHub PR and reading TASK-*.md requirements
2. Setting up the git environment with proper branch management
3. Analyzing the AIPM codebase structure
4. Creating acceptance tests as gating tests
5. Implementing code changes (up to 5 iterations until all tests pass)
6. Committing and pushing changes
7. Returning a JSON status report

I'm ready to proceed when you provide the task details.
