## Story Details
Title: Enable connection to parent User Story

As a: project manager
I want: to connect user stories to different parent stories
So that: I can reorganize story hierarchies and link stories to other branches or root

Description: Allow user stories to connect to different parent stories, enabling flexible hierarchy management across branches or root level

Components: WorkModel

Story Points: 5

Acceptance Tests:
1. Verify root level connection
   Given: I have a child story
   When: I remove the parent connection or set it to root
   Then: the story becomes a root-level story in the hierarchy
2. Verify parent story selection
   Given: I am editing a user story
   When: I select a different parent story from the available options
   Then: the story is successfully linked to the new parent and hierarchy is updated
