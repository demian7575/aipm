Title: Divide the existing "Generate Code & PR" button into two separate buttons: "Generate Code" and "Create PR". And the functionality should be separated accordingly.

As a: User
I want: Divide the existing "Generate Code & PR" button into two separate buttons: "Generate Code" and "Create PR". And the functionality should be separated accordingly. The "Generate Code" buttson should be located each "Development Task" cards, so when click the "Generate Code" button, it should AI(i.e. Kiro) generate code, run gating test(repeat fix and gating test until all gating test are passed, max iteration < 10), and then deploy to development environment
So that: I can accomplish my goals more effectively. This work supports the parent story "AI Module Development"

Story Points: 3

Constraints: 

Acceptance Criteria:
- The feature works as described
- The implementation matches the requirement: Divide the existing "Generate Code & PR" button into two separate buttons: "Generate Code" and "Create PR". And the functionality should be separated accordingly. The "Generate Code" buttson should be located each "Development Task" cards, so when click the "Generate Code" button, it should AI(i.e. Kiro) generate code, run gating test(repeat fix and gating test until all gating test are passed, max iteration < 10), and then deploy to development environment
- The changes are properly tested
