# When I click "Refine with Kiro" button, KIRO CLI termial window should open.

When I click the “Refine with Kiro” button, the KIRO CLI terminal window should open. The terminal must not be a modal window so that it can be moved outside the AIPM web browser window. Before the terminal opens, all required context should be fully loaded in advance.

Constraints: 

Acceptance Criteria:
