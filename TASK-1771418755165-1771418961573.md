## Story Details
Title: US-UX-CICD-001: CI/CD Pipeline Status Visualization

As a: developer
I want: to see CI/CD pipeline status directly on story nodes
So that: I can quickly identify deployment readiness and pipeline failures

Description: Display CI/CD pipeline status for each story node in the mindmap, showing build, test, and deployment states with visual indicators

Story Points: 5

Acceptance Tests:
1. Show detailed pipeline info on hover
   Given: Story node has pipeline status indicator
   When: User hovers over the CI/CD status indicator
   Then: Tooltip displays pipeline stage details,Shows last run timestamp and commit info
2. Display pipeline status on story nodes
   Given: User is viewing the mindmap,Stories have associated PR and pipeline data
   When: Pipeline status is fetched from backend
   Then: Each story node displays a status indicator (success/failure/pending),Color coding reflects pipeline state (green/red/yellow)
