# Story 1768490120028: Enable connection to parent User Story

## Status: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

This story requested the ability to connect user stories to different parent stories, enabling flexible hierarchy management.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (apps/frontend/public/app.js)
- **Parent Story Selector**: Edit modal includes a dropdown (`#parent-story-select`) with all available stories
- **Root Level Option**: Empty value option allows stories to become root-level
- **Dropdown Population**: All stories are loaded into the dropdown, excluding the current story
- **Update Payload**: `parentId` is included in the PATCH request payload

### Backend (apps/backend/app.js)
- **PATCH Endpoint**: `/api/stories/:id` accepts `parentId` in payload
- **Null Handling**: `parentId: null` removes parent connection (root level)
- **DynamoDB Update**: Properly updates or removes `parent_id` field
- **SQLite Sync**: Updates are synchronized to SQLite cache

## Acceptance Tests Verified

### Test 1: Verify parent story selection ✅
- Parent story dropdown exists in edit modal
- All stories are available as options (excluding self)
- Selected parent is properly highlighted
- Update payload includes parentId

### Test 2: Verify root level connection ✅

- Setting parentId to null removes parent connection
- Story becomes root-level in hierarchy
