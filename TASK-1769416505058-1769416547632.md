## Story Details
Title: Remove Dependencies Label from Story Details Panel

As a: project manager
I want: to view the Dependencies section without the redundant "Dependencies" label text
So that: the UI is cleaner with one clear section header instead of duplicate labels

Description: Remove the "Dependencies" label text from the Dependencies section in the story details panel. The section header already indicates this is the Dependencies section, making the label redundant. The dependency information (dependents, dependencies, blocked by, blocking) will continue to display without the extra label text. This change affects only the label display, not the dependency data or functionality.

Components: WorkModel

Story Points: 1

Acceptance Tests:
1. Dependency data remains functional after label removal
   Given: Story with 1 blocking relationship exists
   When: User opens story details panel
   Then: Blocking relationship displays in Dependencies section,No "Dependencies" label text is visible,Dependency functionality works as before
2. Dependencies section displays without label text
   Given: Story details panel is open,Story has 2 dependencies and 1 dependent
   When: User views the Dependencies section
   Then: Section header shows "Dependencies",No additional "Dependencies" label text appears,Dependency information displays correctly
