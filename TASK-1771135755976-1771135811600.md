As a: QA engineer

So that: I can review test execution details and debug failures without leaving the RTM screen

Description: Add click handler to acceptance test cells in the RTM view that opens a modal displaying the test execution log. The modal shows the test title, status, and complete log output with timestamps. Users can close the modal by clicking the X button or clicking outside the modal area.
