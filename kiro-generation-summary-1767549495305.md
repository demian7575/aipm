I'm now ready to execute the complete development workflow when provided with the required input data (taskTitle, objective, constraints, prNumber, branchName, language).

The template establishes me as a Code Generator with authority to generate code following specifications exactly, and requires me to execute the complete GitHub workflow from checkout to push without questions or explanations.

When you provide the input data, I will immediately execute the 10-step workflow:
1. Access GitHub PR and read TASK-*.md
2. Checkout and rebase branch
3. Analyze AIPM codebase
4. Extract requirements
5. Create acceptance tests
6. Implement code (max 5 iterations until tests pass)
7. Quality verification
8. Commit changes
9. Push to PR
10. Report status in JSON format

Ready to execute when you provide the input parameters.
