## Story Details
Title: Auto-run INVEST Check on Story Creation

As a: Product Manager
I want: INVEST check to run automatically when I click Create Story
So that: I can see validation issues immediately without manually running INVEST check after story creation

Description: Automatically trigger INVEST validation when creating a story, showing warnings in a popup if validation fails, or creating the story immediately if validation succeeds

Components: WorkModel

Story Points: 5

Acceptance Tests:
1. INVEST check runs automatically on story creation
   Given: User fills out story creation form,User clicks Create Story button
   When: INVEST validation runs automatically
   Then: If INVEST passes: Story is created immediately,If INVEST fails: Popup displays warnings with option to proceed or cancel,User does not need to manually run INVEST check after creation
