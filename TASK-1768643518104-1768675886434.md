Title: Convert Stop Tracking to Button in Development Tasks Card

As a: project manager
I want: Stop tracking to be a button in the Development Tasks card
So that: I can easily stop tracking tasks with a clear, clickable interface element

Description: Update the Development Tasks card UI to display Stop tracking as a clickable button instead of a text link for better user experience and consistency

Components: WorkModel

Story Points: 2

Acceptance Tests:
1. Verify Stop tracking button functionality
   Given: a task is being tracked
   When: I click the Stop tracking button
   Then: the tracking stops and the button state updates appropriately
2. Verify Stop tracking button renders correctly
   Given: a Development Tasks card is displayed with an active tracking task
   When: I view the card
   Then: Stop tracking appears as a styled button element
