## Story Details
Title: Display SSE Status Indicator During User Story Creation

As a: project manager
I want: to see the SSE connection status with color-coded indicators (yellow, green, red) in the story creation modal header
So that: I know whether real-time updates are working and can troubleshoot connection issues within 5 seconds instead of wondering why changes are not appearing

Description: Add a real-time status indicator that displays Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection status during user story creation. The indicator shows three states: connecting (yellow), connected (green), and disconnected (red) with corresponding text labels. The status appears in the story creation modal header and updates within 1 second of any connection state change. If disconnected for more than 5 seconds, display a retry button.

Components: WorkModel

Story Points: 3

Acceptance Tests:
1. Display SSE status indicator with three connection states
   Given: User opens the story creation modal,SSE connection is being established
   When: Modal header renders
   Then: Yellow indicator with text Connecting appears in header,Indicator changes to green with text Connected within 1 second of successful connection,Indicator changes to red with text Disconnected if connection fails
2. Show retry button when disconnected for more than 5 seconds
   Given: Story creation modal is open,SSE connection shows red Disconnected status for 6 seconds
   When: 5 second timeout expires
   Then: Retry button appears next to the red status indicator,Clicking retry button attempts to reconnect SSE,Status changes to yellow Connecting during retry attempt
3. Show retry button when disconnected for more than 5 seconds
   Given: Story creation modal is open,SSE connection shows red Disconnected status for 6 seconds
   When: 5 second timeout expires
   Then: Retry button appears next to the red status indicator,Clicking retry button attempts to reconnect SSE,Status changes to yellow Connecting during retry attempt
4. Display SSE status indicator with three connection states
   Given: User opens the story creation modal,SSE connection is being established
   When: Modal header renders
   Then: Yellow indicator with text Connecting appears in header,Indicator changes to green with text Connected within 1 second of successful connection,Indicator changes to red with text Disconnected if connection fails
