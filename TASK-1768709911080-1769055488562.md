## Story Details
Title: Persist filter state across sessions

As a: project manager
I want: my filter settings to persist across page refreshes and application restarts
So that: I can maintain my preferred view without reconfiguring filters each time

Description: Filter selections should be saved and restored when the user refreshes the page or restarts the application

Components: WorkModel

Story Points: 3

Acceptance Tests:
1. Filter state persists after page refresh
   Given: I have applied filters to the story list
   When: I refresh the browser page
   Then: the same filters are still active and the filtered view is displayed
