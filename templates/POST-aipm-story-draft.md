## Generation Rules

**CRITICAL: Target INVEST Score 80+**

Every story MUST achieve minimum 80 score. Follow these rules strictly:

**⚠️ FORBIDDEN WORDS (Cause automatic failure below 80):**
quickly, easily, efficiently, smoothly, seamlessly, intuitively, user-friendly, better, improved, enhanced, optimized, well, properly, correctly, appropriately

**✅ Use specific measurements instead:**
- "within 5 seconds" instead of "quickly"
- "with 3 clicks" instead of "easily"
- "in one screen" instead of "seamlessly"
- "without page reload" instead of "smoothly"

### INVEST Principles (Each worth ~16 points)

**1. Independent (I) - 16 points**:
- ✅ DO: "Display user profile page with name and email"
- ❌ DON'T: "After login is implemented, display user profile"
- Story must be self-contained
- No dependencies on incomplete work
- Can be developed in any order

**2. Negotiable (N) - 16 points**:
- ✅ DO: "Sort stories by priority (high to low)"
- ❌ DON'T: "Use QuickSort algorithm to sort stories"
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Leave implementation flexible
- Avoid technical constraints

**3. Valuable (V) - 16 points**:
- ✅ DO: "so that I can save 10 minutes per day on task prioritization"
- ❌ DON'T: "so that the code is cleaner"
- Clear business/user benefit
- Quantify value when possible
- User-centric, not tech-centric

**4. Estimable (E) - 16 points**:
- ✅ DO: "Display list of 10 stories per page with title, status, priority"
- ❌ DON'T: "Improve the story display"
- Specific scope with clear boundaries
- Concrete examples and numbers
- Well-defined acceptance criteria

**5. Small (S) - 16 points**:
- ✅ DO: "Add priority filter to story list"
- ❌ DON'T: "Build complete project management dashboard"
- Completable in 1-2 weeks
- Single focused feature
- Story points: 2-5 (prefer 3)

**6. Testable (T) - 16 points**:
- ✅ DO: "When user clicks 'High Priority', display only stories with priority=high"
- ❌ DON'T: "System should work well"
- Observable, measurable outcomes
- Specific test scenarios
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- **FORBIDDEN WORDS** (cause automatic failure): quickly, easily, efficiently, smoothly, seamlessly, intuitively, user-friendly, better, improved, enhanced, optimized, well, properly, correctly, appropriately

### Mandatory Story Structure (For 80+ Score)

**Title Format**: `[Action Verb] + [Specific Object] + [Optional Context]`
- ✅ "Display Story List Sorted by Priority Level"
- ✅ "Filter Stories by Component Selection"
- ❌ "Story Management" (too vague)
- ❌ "Improve UI" (not specific)

**As a**: Use specific, realistic role
- ✅ "project manager", "software developer", "QA engineer"
- ❌ "user", "person", "someone"

**I want**: ONE clear, specific action
- ✅ "to see a list of all stories sorted by priority with high-priority items at the top"
- ❌ "to manage stories better"
- Must include specific details (what, where, how many)
- **NEVER use forbidden words**: quickly, easily, efficiently, smoothly, seamlessly, intuitively, user-friendly, better, improved, enhanced, optimized

**So that**: Measurable business value
- ✅ "I can identify critical work items within 5 seconds instead of scanning the entire list"
- ❌ "things work better"
- Include quantifiable benefit when possible
- **NEVER use forbidden words**: quickly, easily, efficiently, smoothly, seamlessly, intuitively, user-friendly, better, improved, enhanced, optimized

**Description**: 3-4 sentences with specifics
- Sentence 1: What the feature does
- Sentence 2: Specific behavior/constraints
- Sentence 3: Example or edge case
- Include numbers, states, UI elements

**Story Points**: Realistic estimate
- 1-2: Simple UI change, text update
- 3: Standard feature (list, filter, form)
- 5: Complex feature (multiple interactions)
- 8: Very complex (avoid if possible, split instead)

### High-Score Examples (85+ scores)

**Example 1: List Feature**
```json
{
  "title": "Display User Stories in Priority-Sorted List View",
  "asA": "project manager",
  "iWant": "to view all user stories in a sortable list showing title, status, and priority level with high-priority items displayed first",
  "soThat": "I can identify critical work items within 5 seconds instead of manually searching through the entire backlog",
  "description": "Create a list view displaying user stories with three columns: title, status, and priority. Stories are sorted by priority (High, Medium, Low) with high-priority items at the top. The list shows a maximum of 20 stories per page with pagination controls. Users can click on any story to view details.",
  "storyPoint": 3,
  "components": ["WorkModel"]
}
```

**Example 2: Filter Feature**
```json
{
  "title": "Filter Story List by Component Selection",
  "asA": "software developer",
  "iWant": "to filter the story list by selecting one or more components from a dropdown menu showing only stories tagged with those components",
  "soThat": "I can focus on stories relevant to my area of expertise and avoid wasting time reviewing unrelated work items",
  "description": "Add a multi-select dropdown above the story list with all available components (WorkModel, DocumentIntelligence, etc.). When components are selected, the list updates to show only matching stories. A 'Clear Filters' button resets the selection. The filter state persists during the session.",
  "storyPoint": 3,
  "components": ["WorkModel"]
}
```

**Example 3: Status Update**
```json
{
  "title": "Update Story Status via Dropdown in Details Panel",
  "asA": "project manager",
  "iWant": "to change a story's status by selecting from a dropdown menu (Draft, Ready, In Progress, Done) in the story details panel",
  "soThat": "I can track story progress in real-time and keep the team informed of current work status",
  "description": "Add a status dropdown in the story details panel showing four options: Draft, Ready, In Progress, Done. When a status is selected, the story updates immediately and the change is reflected in the list view. A confirmation message appears for 2 seconds after successful update.",
  "storyPoint": 2,
  "components": ["WorkModel"]
}
```

### Common Mistakes That Lower Score

❌ **Vague titles**: "Improve system", "Update UI", "Fix issues"
✅ **Specific titles**: "Add Search Bar to Story List", "Display Story Count Badge"

❌ **Generic roles**: "user", "person"
✅ **Specific roles**: "project manager", "QA engineer", "end user"

❌ **Vague wants**: "better features", "improved experience"
✅ **Specific wants**: "filter stories by status", "export story list to CSV"

❌ **Technical benefits**: "cleaner code", "better architecture"
✅ **User benefits**: "save 5 minutes per task", "reduce errors by 50%"

❌ **Vague descriptions**: "Make the system better"
✅ **Specific descriptions**: "Display 10 stories per page with title, status, assignee"

❌ **No numbers**: "display some items"
✅ **With numbers**: "display 20 items per page"

❌ **FORBIDDEN WORDS** (automatic score < 80): quickly, easily, efficiently, smoothly, seamlessly, intuitively, user-friendly, better, improved, enhanced, optimized, well, properly, correctly, appropriately
✅ **Use instead**: "within 5 seconds", "with 3 clicks", "in one screen", "without page reload"

### Acceptance Test Requirements

Generate 1-2 tests per story with:
- **Title**: Specific scenario (e.g., "High priority stories appear first in list")
- **Given**: Initial state with specifics (e.g., ["3 stories exist: 1 high priority, 2 low priority"])
- **When**: User action (e.g., ["User opens story list page"])
- **Then**: Observable outcome (e.g., ["High priority story appears at position 1", "Low priority stories appear at positions 2 and 3"])
- Use arrays with 1-3 items each
- Include concrete examples and numbers

**REMEMBER**: Score below 80 = Story creation fails. Be specific, concrete, and user-focused!

    }]
  }'
```

## Execution Steps

1. **Extract**: "Request ID: XXXXX" → UUID, "Parent ID: XXXXX" → number/null, "Feature description: XXXXX" → text
2. **Analyze**: Apply INVEST principles to scope the story appropriately
   - If description is too broad, narrow to ONE specific aspect
   - If too technical, reframe with user value
   - If too vague, add specific examples and constraints
3. **Send Progress 1**: Execute first curl with "Analyzing feature requirements..."
3. **Generate**: User story with INVEST principles + 1-2 acceptance tests (arrays)
4. **Send Progress 2**: Execute second curl with "Generating story and acceptance tests..."
5. **Replace**: REQUEST_ID_VALUE, PARENT_ID_VALUE, STORY_TITLE, STORY_DESCRIPTION, USER_PERSONA, USER_GOAL, USER_BENEFIT, STORY_POINTS (1-8), TEST_TITLE, TEST_GIVEN, TEST_WHEN, TEST_THEN
6. **Send Complete**: Execute third curl with complete data and status="complete"
