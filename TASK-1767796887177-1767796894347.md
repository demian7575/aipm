## Story Details
Title: Automatic Version Numbering System

As a: DevOps engineer
I want: automatic version numbering using PR number and commit SHA format
So that: I can track and identify specific deployment versions in development environments

Description: Implement automatic version numbering system that generates version identifiers using PR number and commit SHA format for development environment deployments

Story Points: 5

Acceptance Tests:
1. Version format generation
   Given: a PR number and commit SHA are available
   When: the version numbering system is triggered
   Then: a version identifier is generated in PR-SHA format
2. Development deployment versioning
   Given: a development deployment is initiated
   When: the automatic versioning system runs
   Then: the deployment is tagged with the generated version identifier
