[                                                                 > Based on our conversation summary, I know that the version display feature has already been fully implemented. The 
AIPM version display functionality is complete with the following components:

Already Implemented:
- Version display element in the header: <span id="version-display" class="version-display"></span>
- fetchVersion() function that calls /api/version endpoint
- Backend /api/version endpoint that reads from package.json
- PR number detection in development environments using PR_NUMBER environment variable
- CSS styling with .version-display class
- Displays as v{version} in production or v{version} (PR #{pr}) in development

Current Status:
- Version is displayed in the application header next to "AI Project Manager Mindmap"
- Shows version from package.json (currently "0.1.0")
- In development, shows PR number when PR_NUMBER environment variable is set
- Automatically fetched when the application loads

The acceptance criteria are already met - users can see which version of AIPM is working through the version badge 
displayed in the application header, and in development environments, it shows the GitHub PR number as requested.

This feature was successfully implemented earlier in our conversation and supports the "Simple and Clear Appearance" 
parent story by providing clear version information to users.
