## Story Details
Title: Automatic Version Numbering for Development Deployments

As a: DevOps engineer
I want: automatic version numbering using PR number and commit SHA
So that: I can easily identify and track specific versions deployed in development environments

Description: Implement a system that automatically generates version identifiers using PR number and commit SHA format for development environment deployments to enable better tracking and identification of deployed versions.

Story Points: 5

Acceptance Tests:
1. Development deployment integration
   Given: a development deployment is initiated
   When: the automatic version numbering system runs
   Then: the generated version identifier is applied to the deployment artifacts
2. Version format generation
   Given: a PR number 123 and commit SHA abc1234
   When: the version numbering system is triggered
   Then: it generates a version identifier in format PR123-abc1234
