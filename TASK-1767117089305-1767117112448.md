## Story Details
Title: Auto-Generate Acceptance Tests in Create Child Story Modal

As a: Product Manager using the AIPM workspace
I want: to automatically generate acceptance tests when creating child stories
So that: I can ensure comprehensive test coverage without manual effort and maintain story quality standards

Description: When click 'Generate' button on the "Create Child Story" modal that automatically creates acceptance tests for the user story. When clicked, the system should use AI to analyze the story content and generate relevant acceptance tests in Given-When-Then format. A new 'Acceptance Tests' field should appear below the existing modal content(Update "Create Child Story" modal needed) to display and allow editing of the generated tests before saving the story.
