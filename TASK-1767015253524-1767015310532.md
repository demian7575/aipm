## Story Details
Title: Remove "Refine with Kiro" button and connected codes

As a: developer
I want: to remove the "Refine with Kiro" button and all its connected code
So that: the interface is cleaner and unnecessary features are eliminated without causing regressions

Description: Remove the "Refine with Kiro" button and all associated code from the UI while carefully identifying and handling potential side effects to prevent breaking existing functionality.
