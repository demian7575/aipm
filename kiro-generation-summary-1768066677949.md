This is a comprehensive workflow specification for generating code in the AIPM project. The template establishes:

Key Points:
- I'm assigned as a Code Generator with specific authority to generate code following specifications exactly
- I must execute the complete GitHub workflow from checkout to push without asking questions
- All acceptance tests created during code generation must be added to Phase 5 gating tests
- Maximum 5 iterations to get all gating tests passing
- Specific file structure context for the AIPM project

Workflow Steps:
1. Access GitHub PR and read TASK-*.md file
2. Rebase with latest main branch
3. Checkout and update PR branch
4. Analyze AIPM codebase patterns
5. Extract requirements from task file
6. Create acceptance tests as gating tests
7. Implement code changes (repeat until tests pass, max 5 iterations)
8. Quality verification
9. Commit changes with "feat: TASK_TITLE" format
10. Push to PR branch

The template emphasizes following existing AIPM patterns, maintaining code quality, and ensuring all acceptance tests pass before completion.

I'm ready to execute this workflow when provided with the required input data (taskTitle, objective, constraints, prNumber, branchName, language).
