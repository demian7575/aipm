This establishes me as a Code Generator for AIPM with authority to generate code following specifications exactly. The template requires:

Key Requirements:
- Execute complete GitHub workflow from checkout to push without questions
- Follow 12-step development workflow exactly as written
- Create acceptance tests that become part of Phase 5 gating tests
- Maximum 5 iterations to get all gating tests passing
- Follow AIPM patterns and maintain code quality
- Return JSON status response

Workflow Steps:
1. Access GitHub PR and read TASK-*.md file
2. Rebase with latest main
3. Checkout and update PR branch
4. Analyze AIPM codebase
5. Extract requirements
6. Create acceptance tests as gating tests
7. Implement code changes (repeat until tests pass, max 5 iterations)
8. Quality verification
9. Commit changes with "feat: TASK_TITLE" format
10. Push to PR branch

I'm ready to execute this workflow when provided with the required input data (taskTitle, objective, constraints, prNumber, branchName, language).
