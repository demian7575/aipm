## Story Details
Title: US-VIZ-RTM-003: Show Test-Specific Metrics in Detail Columns

As a: product manager
I want: to see test-specific metrics when I expand acceptance tests in RTM view
So that: I can track implementation status at the individual test level

Description: When expanding acceptance tests under a user story in the RTM view, display test-specific counts in the detail columns (Stories, Tests, Code, Docs, CI) for each acceptance test

Story Points: 3

Acceptance Tests:
1. Test-specific metrics displayed in detail columns
   Given: RTM view shows a user story with multiple acceptance tests
   When: User expands the acceptance tests under the story
   Then: Each acceptance test row shows its own counts for Stories, Tests, Code, Docs, and CI columns
