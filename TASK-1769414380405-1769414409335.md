## Story Details
Title: Remove Dependencies Label from Story Details View

As a: project manager
I want: to remove the redundant "Dependencies" label from the Dependencies section in story details
So that: the UI is cleaner with no duplicate text in the dependencies area

Description: Remove the "Dependencies" label text from the Dependencies section in the story details panel. The section will still display dependency information but without the redundant label. This simplifies the UI by removing duplicate text since the section header already indicates it is the Dependencies section.

Components: WorkModel
